K-Means clustering is one of the most commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms in data science. It is used to automatically segment datasets into clusters or groups based on similarities between data points.

The K-Means algorithm works as follows:

Specify the number of clusters K that you want the data to be grouped into.
Randomly initialize K cluster centers or centroids. This can be done by randomly picking K data points to be the initial centroids.
Assign each data point to the closest cluster centroid based on Euclidean distance. The data points closest to a given centroid are considered part of that cluster.
Recompute the cluster centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids stop moving or the iterations reach a specified limit. This is done when the algorithm has converged.
